    I'm a <i>postdoctoral research fellow</i> at the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/">Australian Institute for Machine Learning</a>. I'm also the <i>Director of AI applications</i>. My role includes:
    <p>
      1. Leading the development of machine learning for practical applications;
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Assisting partner organisations to understand how machine learning can be turned into applications;
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Provisioning training in the applications of machine learning on real world problems. 
    </p>
<h4>What am I working on?</h4>
    <p>
    I work at the interface of computer vision, machine learning and challenging industry problems, developing algorithms that allow computers to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, by perceiving the world in    three dimensions and reasoning about images’ content.
    </p>
    <h4>
    How did I come to be here?
    </h4>
    <p>
    I was introduced to computer vision and image processing by Professor Jules Tapamo, an inspirational lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. I completed a master’s degree under his tutelage and came to Australia to pursue a PhD.

    Before I arrived here, I had an opportunity to attend a machine learning lecture series presented by Professor Ernest Fokoue, from New York’s Rochester Institute of Technology. This sparked my imagination and convinced me that I wanted to work at the interface of machine learning and computer vision.

    I started my PhD at the University of Adelaide in late 2009 and completed it in 2013, then stayed on as a postdoctoral researcher at AIML (then the Australian Centre for Visual Technologies).
