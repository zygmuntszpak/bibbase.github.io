# Code

Nowadays I do all of my new software development in the fantastic programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I am a member of the [Julia Images organisation](https://github.com/JuliaImages)—an organisation that maintains numerous free and open-source Julia image processing packages. 

I have twice served as a mentor for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program. Google Summer of Code is a global program where students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

All of my code is hosted on my [Github](http://github.com/zygmuntszpak) account.


### Ellipse Fitting 
I am in the process of reimplementing some of my previous work on ellipse fitting in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

* Szpak, Z., Chojnacki, W. and Van Den Hengel, A.
  *Guaranteed ellipse fitting with the Sampson distance*

### Multiple-view Geometry
I am developing a comprehensive Julia multiple-view geometry package which will be available soon. The package will also include implementations of my published algorithms.

### Image Processing
I have developed or co-developed several free and open-source Julia Image Processing packages. 

#### Image Binarization
The [ImageBinarization.jl](https://github.com/zygmuntszpak/ImageBinarization.jl) package contains numerous algorithms for analyzing images and automatically binarizing them into background and foreground.

#### Image Contrast Adjustment
The [ImageContrastAdjustment.jl](https://github.com/zygmuntszpak/ImageContrastAdjustment.jl) package contains several methods for enhancing and manipulating image contrast. It includes, for example, histogram equalization, gamma correction and contrast stretching.
